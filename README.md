# Boid Simulation in Unity 3D

A Unity 3D implementation of the Boid algorithm with object avoidance. This project simulates flocking behavior and enhances it with obstacle detection by casting equally spaced points around a sphere.

## Features

- **Flocking Behavior:** Implements Craig Reynolds' Boid algorithm, including separation, alignment, and cohesion.
- **Object Avoidance:** Uses spherical point casting to detect and navigate around obstacles.

## Future Additions

- **Quadtree Optimization:** Improve performance by spatially partitioning boids to reduce computational overhead.
- **Compute Shader Acceleration:** Utilize GPU processing to handle thousands of boids efficiently.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Handling:** Implement real-time adjustments for moving obstacles.
